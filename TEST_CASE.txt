TEST CASES FOR LinkedList AND Pet CLASSES

1. Empty List Operations
   - Actions:
     - Call displayList() on an empty list.
     - Call deleteNode(1) on an empty list.
     - Call editNode(1) on an empty list.
   - Expected Result: 
     - displayList() should print a message indicating the list is empty.
     - deleteNode(1) should handle gracefully with no error.
     - editNode(1) should handle gracefully with no error.

2. Adding Nodes
   - Actions:
     - Append multiple Pet objects to the list.
     - Display the list after each addition.
   - Expected Result: 
     - Each appendNode() call should add a Pet to the end of the list.
     - `displayList()` should show all added pets in order.

3. Removing Nodes (from start, middle, end)
   - Actions:
     - Remove the first node.
     - Remove a middle node.
     - Remove the last node.
   - Expected Result:
     - First node removal updates head correctly.
     - Middle node removal links previous node to the next node.
     - Last node removal updates the tail pointer correctly.

4. Editing Nodes
   - Actions:
     - Edit the first node’s data.
     - Edit a middle node’s data.
     - Edit the last node’s data.
   - Expected Result:
     - Updated information for each node should be reflected when displayed.

5. Sorting Nodes (Ascending and Descending)
   - Actions:
     - Sort list in ascending order.
     - Display list.
     - Sort list in descending order.
     - Display list.
   - Expected Result:
     - Ascending sort should arrange pets from youngest to oldest.
     - Descending sort should arrange pets from oldest to youngest.

6. Edge Cases for Out of Range Calls
   - Actions:
     - Call deleteNode(-1), deleteNode(1000) on a non-empty list.
     - Call editNode(-1), editNode(1000) on a non-empty list.
   - Expected Result:
     - Both methods handle out-of-range indices without errors.

7. Edge Cases: Adding, Emptying, and Displaying List
   - Actions:
     - Add multiple Pet objects.
     - Remove each node one by one until the list is empty.
     - Call displayList() after each removal.
   - Expected Result:
     - The list should successfully remove each node.
     - displayList() should show no nodes after the list is emptied.
