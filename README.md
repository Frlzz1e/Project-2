For our project 2 we will re-use our idea from project-1, a vet office. Our linked list class will be a list of all the animals in our clinic. The private data will contain the pets information (Type, Name, Age, Balance). We will be able to add a pet, get a pet inoformation, and check out a pet. We will have a function that sorts the pets by age. Our new class will be operations. The operations will be able to change the balance assigned to each pet. We will use a smart pointer to track the number of operations that have been done on an animal. It will caompare to see how many has been done and if it can get another operation.
